        <h1>'Things Happen' Trump defends Saudi crown Prince over Khashogi killing</h1>
        <p>2 hours ago</p>
        <p>at the White House</p>
        <img src="img/trumpandjamal.jpg" alt="Trump and Jamal Khashogi">
        <p style="width: 1300px; font:">US President Donald Trump has said Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman
       "knew nothing" about the 2018 killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, as he welcomed
       the kingdom's de facto ruler to the White House.

       Trump's comments appeared to contradict a US intelligence assessment in 2021 which
       determined the crown prince had approved the operation that led to Khashoggi's death
       at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in 2018.

       The crown prince, who has denied any wrongdoing, said at the White House that Saudi 
       Arabia "did all the right things" to investigate Khashoggi's death.
       
       It was his first visit to the US since the assassination, which sent shockwaves through
       the US-Saudi relationship.
       
       In the Oval Office on Tuesday, Trump shot back at a reporter who asked a question about 
       the killing.
       
       "You're mentioning someone that was extremely controversial," the US president said.
        "A lot of people didn't like that gentleman that you're talking about. Whether you 
        like him or didn't like him, things happen."

        "But he [the Crown Prince] knew nothing about it," Trump added. "You don't have to 
        embarrass our guests."
        
        The crown prince added that Saudi Arabia "did all the right steps" to investigate the 
        murder, which he called "painful" and a "huge mistake".

        A US intelligence report made public in 2021 - under President Joe Biden's administration
        - determined that the crown prince had approved of a plan to "capture or kill" Khashoggi 
        in Istanbul. During his first administration, Trump White House officials declined to release the report.

        While dozens of Saudi officials faced sanctions in the wake of the assassination, none 
        directly targeted the crown prince.
        
        At the time, Saudi Arabia rejected the report as "negative, false and unacceptable".

        On Tuesday, Khashoggi's widow called on the crown prince to apologise for her husband's 
        murder, for which she said there was "no justification".

        "The Crown Prince said he was sorry so he should meet me, apologize and compensate me 
        for the murder of my husband @JKhashoggi," Hanan Elatr Khashoggi posted on X. Granted 
        political asylum in the US, she lives in the Washington DC area.

        Tuesday's meeting between Trump and Mohammed bin Salman was expected to include deals 
        on civilian nuclear power, artificial intelligence and Saudi investment in the US, which 
        the crown prince said was being upped to $1tr (£761bn) from $600bn pledged earlier this year.

        Echoing Trump's own words, bin Salman said that the US was the "hottest country on the planet"
        and praised the US president for creating "long-term opportunity".

        The two men also discussed the potential sale of advanced F-35 fighter aircraft to the Saudis.
        Trump said that while export licences were still being announced, he expected a deal between the 
        Saudis and US defence giant Lockheed Martin.

        The potential sale has caused alarm among some Israeli officials, who have said that it could 
        potentially hurt the country's "qualitative military edge" in the Middle East, where it is so 
        far the only nation to have F-35s.

        The US president said the model sold to the Saudis would be broadly similar to the one the Israelis operate.
        "This [Saudi Arabia] is a great ally, and Israel is a great ally," Trump said. "I know they'd like you to 
        get planes of reduced calibre.

        "But as far as I'm concerned, I think they are both at a level where they should get top of the line," he added.
        The crown prince's visit to Washington continues with a gala dinner on Tuesday night, followed by an investment 
        summit on Wednesday.

        Portuguese footballer Cristiano Ronaldo - who plays in the Saudi professional league - was also expected 
        to be at the White House on Tuesday, a White House official confirmed to the BBC.
        
        Biden did not host the crown prince and vowed to make Saudi Arabia a "pariah" over its human rights record. 
        In 2022, however, Biden visited the kingdom to reach agreement on other issues.</p>
