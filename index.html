                <caption style="color: grey;">Watch: Trump says Saudi crown prince "knew nothing" about Jamal Khashoggi's murder</caption>
                <p>US President Donald Trump has said Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman
                    "knew nothing" about the 2018 killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, as he welcomed
                    the kingdom's de facto ruler to the White House.</p>

                <p>Trump's comments appeared to contradict a US intelligence assessment in 2021 which
                    determined the crown prince had approved the operation that led to Khashoggi's death
                    at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in 2018.</p>

                <p>The crown prince, who has denied any wrongdoing, said at the White House that Saudi
                    Arabia "did all the right things" to investigate Khashoggi's death, which he called painful</p>

                <p>It was his first visit to the US since the assassination, which sent shockwaves through
                    the US-Saudi relationship.</p>

                <p>In the Oval Office on Tuesday, Trump shot back at a reporter who asked a question about
                    the killing.</p>

                <p>"You're mentioning someone that was extremely controversial," the US president said.</p>

                <p>"A lot of people didn't like that gentleman that you're talking about. Whether you
                    like him or didn't like him, things happen."</p>

                <p>"But he [the Crown Prince] knew nothing about it," Trump added. "You don't have to
                    embarrass our guests."</p>

                <p>The crown prince added that Saudi Arabia "did all the right steps" to investigate the
                    murder, which he called "painful" and a "huge mistake".</p>

                <p>A US intelligence report made public in 2021 - under President Joe Biden's administration
                    - determined that the crown prince had approved of a plan to "capture or kill" Khashoggi
                    in Istanbul. During his first administration, Trump White House officials declined to release the
                    report.</p>

                <p>While dozens of Saudi officials faced sanctions in the wake of the assassination, none
                    directly targeted the crown prince.</p>

                <caption style="color: grey;">Hanan Khashoggi, Jamal Khashoggi's widow, speaks to BBC after Trump defends Saudi crown prince</caption>

                <p>Reacting to Trump's comments, Khashoggi's widow, Hanan, told BBC Newsnight the US president's defence
                    of
                    the crown prince did not match up with bin Salman's own acknowledgment of responsibility for her
                    husband's murder.</p>

                <p>">The crown prince himself, in 2019 and 60 Minutes interview, he did take accountability about and
                    hold
                    responsibility about this horrible crime," she said.</p>

                <p>In a post on X, she also called for a meeting with the crown prince and an apology along with
                    compensation for her husband's murder.</p>

                <p>Granted political asylum in the US, she lives in the Washington DC area.</p>

                <p>Tuesday's meeting between Trump and Mohammed bin Salman was expected to include deals on civilian
                    nuclear power, artificial intelligence and Saudi investment in the US, which the crown prince said
                    was
                    being upped to $1tr (£761bn) from $600bn pledged earlier this year.</p>

                <p>Echoing Trump's own words, bin Salman said that the US was the "hottest country on the planet" and
                    praised the US president for creating "long-term opportunity".</p>

                <p>The two men also discussed the potential sale of advanced F-35 fighter aircraft to the Saudis.

                <p>Trump said that while export licences were still being announced, he expected a deal between the
                    Saudis
                    and US defence giant Lockheed Martin.</p>

                <p>The potential sale has caused alarm among some Israeli officials, who have said that it could
                    potentially hurt the country's "qualitative military edge" in the Middle East, where it is so far
                    the
                    only nation to have F-35s.</p>

                <p>The US president said the model sold to the Saudis would be broadly similar to the one the Israelis
                    operate.</p>

                <p>"This [Saudi Arabia] is a great ally, and Israel is a great ally," Trump said. "I know they'd like
                    you
                    to get planes of reduced calibre.</p>

                <p>"But as far as I'm concerned, I think they are both at a level where they should get top of the
                    line,"
                    he added.</p>

                <p>The crown prince's visit to Washington continues with a gala dinner on Tuesday night, followed by an
                    investment summit on Wednesday.</p>

                <p>Portuguese footballer Cristiano Ronaldo - who plays in the Saudi professional league - <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c993e74pxd7o">was also
                    present at the dinner</a>.</p>

                <p>Biden did not host the crown prince and vowed to make Saudi Arabia a "pariah" over its human rights
                    record. In 2022, however, Biden visited the kingdom to reach agreement on other issues.</p>
